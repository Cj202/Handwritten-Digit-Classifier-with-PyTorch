ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a handwritten digit classifier built using PyTorch and the MNIST dataset. It trains a simple neural network to recognize digits from 0 to 9.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Loads the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits).
âœ… Trains a neural network to classify digits.
âœ… Uses PyTorch for model training.
âœ… Saves and loads the trained model.
âœ… Tests the model's accuracy on unseen data.
